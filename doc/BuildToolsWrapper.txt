                                        *BTW-presentation*
Presentation~

This plugin serves two distinct, but related, purposes:
- define a flexible alternative to Vim |compiler-plugin|s,
  -> |BTW-filters|,
- and ease the compilation of projects
  -> |BTW-Build-Execute|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                        *BTW-filters*
Filter-plugins~

Purpose~
BuildToolsWrapper.vim offers an alternative and modular way to define and use
|compiler-plugin|s.  The classical approach consists in defining as many
compiler-plugins as we have unique environments in which we compile our
programs.  With BuildToolsWrapper.vim we can define independant filters, and
choose which ones to use regarding to our environment and project.

For instance in a project, we can load the filters for A-A-P, GCC, and Cygwin,
if we are using Cygwin-tools from win32-Vim. In another, we will use gmake
filter instead of A-A-P filter, and still use GCC filter and may be even a
filter wrapping STLFit (<http://www.bdsoft.com/tools/stlfilt.html>).


Generalities~
BuildToolsWrapper.vim distinguishes two kind of plugins:
- the ones associated to the main build tool ((g)Make, A-A-P, bjam, scons, ant,
  ...)
- and the ones associated to the various tools involded in the build chain. That
  is to say the various compilers, linkers and other programs (Test Unit
  Frameworks, Documentation tools, ...) used.


BTW filter-plugins can define two different, but related, things:
- the 'errorformat' associated to a tool.  |g:BTW_adjust_efm_{tool}|
- the external filter that must be applied over the results of the compilation
  process.  |[bg]:BTW_filter_program_{tool}|

Last thing, a distinction is made between global and local definitions. As with
compiler-plugins, we should prefer local definitions over global ones. Every
time the definitions of a filter are loaded by |:BTW|, we can choose to use them
globally or locally to the current buffer. Every local setting overrides the
global settings.

                                                        *:BTW*
:BTW, The filters management command~

The filters used in a specific project are managed with the command :BTW.

This command accepts the following sub-commands:

- :BTW set      {main-filter}                           *:BTW-set*
- :BTW setlocal {main-filter}                           *:BTW-setlocal*
  These two commands set the main filter-plugin, i.e. the one associated to the
  build tool -- i.e. make, A-A-P, scons, bjam, ...
  With "setlocal", we override the main filter-plugin.

- :BTW add      {filter}                                *:BTW-add*
- :BTW addlocal {filter}                                *:BTW-addlocal*
  These two commands add a filter-plugin at the end of the chain
  of filter-plugins applied over the result of the compilation process.
  The order of the filters applied respects the order of the calls to
  ":BTW add(local)".
  With "addlocal", we override (ignore), in the scope of the current buffer, the
  filter-plugins globally loaded.
  ? must add-global apply to local lists when they already exist ?

- :BTW remove      {filter}                             *:BTW-remove*
- :BTW removelocal {filter}                             *:BTW-removelocal*
  Remove a filter-plugin from the chain of filter-plugins applied.
  global: the filter-plugin will also be removed from every buffer-local list
  local:  if there is no local list, and the filter is found in the global list,
          then a local list is build from the global one, but without the
          filter.
          todo: retest

- :BTW clear      {filter}                              *:BTW-clear*
- :BTW clearlocal {filter}                              *:BTW-clearlocal*
  Full reset of the filter-plugins used. This command can be seen as an
  alternative to calling |:BTW-remove| on every filter-plugin.
  Yet to be implemented

- :BTW rebuild                                          *:BTW-rebuild*
  Little helper command. Only useful when the vim script (that defines a
  filter-plugin) has been changed, and we want to refresh 'makeprg' and
  'errorformat' in consequence.

- :BTW echo {expr}                                      *:BTW-echo*
  Debug oriented helper function. It serves to evaluate and display an internal
  (script scope -> s:) data/function from BuildToolsWrapper.vim.

In order to ease the use of |:BTW|, this command supports a smart
auto-completion.

Default filters~

A few filter-plugins are shipped with BuildToolsWrapper.

Main filter-plugins~
- A-A-P (<http://www.a-a-p.org/>)
  The filter-plugin defines:
  - the program to use according to the OS -> aap or aap.bat
  - a few adjustments to the 'errorformat', in order to take into account some
    error messages from A-A-P.

- (g)make.
  filter-plugin yet to be written... It will contain folding stuff.

Other filter-plugins~
- GCC, the filter-plugin defines:
  - the typical settings for 'errorformat' (may be enhanced/corrected in the
    future)
  - a way to have clickable link-error messages, and to regroup them. This
    feature is acheived thanks to an external perl filter ; and a few syntax
    highlighting additions have added for the "qf" filetype.
    Regarding the options available to the end user:
    - *g:BTW_gcc_group_lnk* (boolean [1] ?) indicates whether we wish to regroup
      the link-errors
    - *g:BTW_gcc_click_lnk* (boolean [1] ?) indicates whether we wish to have
      clickable link-errors.
    - *g:BTW_gcc_obj_dir* (string: ['']) directory where the object files will
      be stored.
    - *g:BTW_gcc_src_dir* (string ['']) directory where the translation units
      are.

- TreeProject
  See this filter-plugin as an example of what can be done.
  The filter-plugin will find and set, on a buffer-basis, which makefile must be
  used, according to the directory (matching an independant subcomponent of a
  big project) in which the files of the buffer is stored.

- Cygwin (<http://www.cygwin.org>)
  This filter-plugin is useful when we use cygwin tools to compile anything from
  the win32 native version of Vim. Indeed, win32-vim does not understand Cygwin
  symbolic links, nor Cygwin absolute paths.
  That's why there is a {rtp}/compiler/BTW/cygwin.vim. This plugin relies on an
  external perl script.

                                                        *BTW-write-filter*
Write a filter-plugin~

The filter-plugin {name} is supposed to be associated to the file
{rtp}/compiler/BTW/{name}.vim, where {rtp} refers to any directory from the
'runtimepath'.


Many things can be done in these filter-plugin, however, BuildToolsWrapper waits
for two (optional) settings:
- *[bg]:BTW_filter_program_{tool}*
  It could be any external program: a perl script with its arguments, a
  call to make after having changed the current directory, ..., or even a
  |FuncRef| (see compiler/BTW/cmake.vim)
- *g:BTW_adjust_efm_{tool}*
  This is used to define the 'errorformat' for the quick-fix window.
  In order to support post-treatments on &efm value, this variable can be a
  |Dictionary| of the form: >
    {"value": string, "post": FuncRef}


Note: there are a few variables you will see from Vim. However, do not
manipulate them directly. They are actually internal variables you must ignore.
-> `[bg]:BTW_filters_list`, `[bg]:BTW_build_tool`


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                        *BTW-Build-Execute*
Build and Execute~

BTW also serves to ease the compilation of projects and execute programs built.

The different possible operations are:

                                                        *:Make*
Building a program...~
The command |:Make| accepts an optional target. The default target is determined
according to the heuristic described in |BTW-project-target|.

By default, |:Make| (with no argument) is binded to <F7>. This can be overrided
with the option |g:BTW.key.make|.

                                                        *:Make-background*
...in background...~
The compilation will be done in background if *g:BTW.make_in_background* is
set to 1. This option is best set in |.vimrc|, and best changed with
*:ToggleMakeBG* , or the related |menu| under `Project`.

...with jobs~
If a sufficient version of Vim is detected (at least v7.4-1980), the
compilation will be done thanks to the new +|job| feature.  By default, the
quickfix window will scroll automatically to show last errors -- given a
recent enough version of Vim (v7.4.1997) that implements |:cbottom|. To stop
the scrolling, jump to the |quickfix-window|, and execute |:Copen| to
reactivate it.
You can also set the option *g:BTW.autoscroll_background_compilation*
to 0 to completly disable this autoscrolling feature.

The background compilation (based on |+job|) can be stopped at any time thanks
to |:StopBGExecution|

...or with perl~
With older versions of Vim, perl will be required to run `make` into the
background.

                                                        *:Make-multijobs*
...with multiple jobs~
The compilation can be done with multiple jobs thanks to
*g:BTW.make_multijobs* option. Set it to the number of jobs you wish to use.
This feature makes sense only with `make` executables that provide the `-j`
option.
The option value can be toggled with *:ToggleMakeMJ* or the related |menu|.

                                                        *:Execute*
Executing a program~
The command |:Execute| accepts no arguments. The default program to execute is
determined according to the heuristic described in |BTW-project-executable|.

Arguments to the program can be specified with the option
|(bpg):BTW.run_parameters|.

By default, |:Execute| (with no argument) is binded to <C-F5> This can be
overrided with the option |[bpg]:BTW.key_execute|.

                                                        *BTW-Build-Configure*
Configuration of the build process~
A little helper is provided for when we can rely on gmake to automatically
compile programs made of only one translation unit (.c, .cpp, ...). Typically
small test programs, and not real projects.

Depending on |(bpg):BTW.project_config|  `.how` field, *:Config* will:
- `"modeline"` -> Help to add a |let-modeline| for various environment
                variables like `$CFLAGS`, `$CXXFLAGS`, `$LDFLAGS`, `$LDLIBS`,
                |(bpg):BTW.project|, ... The let-modeline will be added at the
                bottom of the edited file.
                Pointless if you haven't installed my |let-modeline.vim|
                plugin.
- `"makefile"` -> Jump to the `Makefile` associated to the `.wd` key.
- `"ccmake"`   -> execute `ccmake {.how.arg}` (or `cmake-gui {.how.arg}`)
                from `(bpg):BTW.project_config.wd` directory.

Depending on |(bpg):BTW.project_config|  `.how` field, *:ReConfig* will:
- `"modeline"` -> reload the |let-modeline| with |:FirstModeline|;
- `"makefile"` -> do nothing (for now?);
- `"ccmake"`   -> execute `cmake .` from the right directory;

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
                                                        *BTW-keybindings*

*g:BTW.key.make*       (def. <F7>)   keybinding associated to |:Make|.
*g:BTW.key.execute*    (def. <C-F5>) keybinding associated to |:Execute|.
*g:BTW.key.config*     (def. <M-F7>) keybinding associated to |:Config|.
*g:BTW.key.re_config*  (def. <M-F8>) keybinding associated to |:ReConfig|.

Heuristics~

                                                        *BTW-project-target*
Target heuristics~
The target used by |:Make| is chosen according to the following rule.
- First |:Make| tries to use the option *(bpg):BTW.target*
- If not set, it tries to use the target from the heuristics |BTW-project-name|.
- If nothing is returned, "all" is assumed.

                                                        *BTW-project-executable*
Executable heuristics~
The executable used by |:Execute| is chosen according to the following rule.
- |:Execute| tries to use the option *(bpg):BTW.executable*
- If not set, it tries to use the name from the heuristics |BTW-project-name|,
  to which it may add ".exe" if vim is runned under Windows. (MsDos is not taken
  into account)
- If nothing is returned, nothing is returned.
  I will eventually try to detect acceptable executables in the build directory.

                                                        *BTW-project-name*
Project name heuristics~
The name of the project is defined by *(bpg):BTW.project* , if set. If not, it
uses the name of the file in the current buffer (|%<|), or the name of the file
from alternate buffer (|#<|) if we are in the |quickfix-window|.

                                                        *BTW-quickfix*
Options for the Quickfix window~

Several options permit to tune how the |quickfix-window| is handled by |:Make|,
|:Cwin| and |:Copen|.

*g:BTW.qf_position* defines where the |quickfix-window| will be opened.
Typical values match the commands: |:vert|, |:lefta|, |:abo|, ...

*g:BTW.qf_size* defines the maximum heigth of the |quickfix-window|. The default
value is 1/4 of vim screen/window ('lines').
Note: the corresponding code has been stolen from |LaTeX-Suite|.

*g:BTW.goto_error* defines whether |:Make| will automatically jump to the
first error. The default value is true (1).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                        *BTW-requirements*
External requirements~

BTW depends on the following plugins:
- |lh-vim-lib| v4.0.0

A few other scripts of mine will be useful with BTW.
- |local_vimrc| is a plugin that permits to define options (and any other things
  like mappings, functions, ...) that will be local to the files in the
  sub-directories of the one where there are _vimrc_local.vim files.
  (local_vimrc is a plugin that enables local .vimrc's named _vimrc_local.vim)
- |lh-compil-hint|


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                        *BTW-deprecated-options*

In Version 0.7.0, option naming policy has changed. Old variable names are
still supported for the moment.

The idea is to store options in the |dictionaries| *g:BTW.* , *p:BTW.* (a
|p:|roject variable) and *b:BTW.* instead of the multiple `g:BTW_xxx` and
`b:BTW_xxx` variables.

Here is the translation table:
